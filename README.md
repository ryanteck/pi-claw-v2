# pi-claw-v2
Open source Claw Machine Controller

The plan of this is to have my Pi powered claw machine fully open source. The plan being the software is under GPL V3 and possibility of the hardware being under OSHW.

To begin with it'll be developed for my machine which has the more common UK format of two buttons for movement rather than a joystick.
